# Mentions

This project simulates the action of mentioning an user in posts/comments.

For this, I used the library [zurb/tribute](https://github.com/zurb/tribute).

## Prerequisites

- Ruby `2.7.1`;
- Rails `6.0.3`;

## Getting started

Install dependencies running `bundle instal` and `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Create database and apply migrations running `rails db:create db:migrate`.

And run server with `rails s`.
